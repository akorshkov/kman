kman - my cheatsheets.
======================

Summary
-------
Help information for all linux commands are always available. Still I need to have a cheatsheet
for some of them. `kman` is a python script which displays my cheatsheets. Like this:

```
	kman git
```

Installation:
-------------

1. Checkout `kman`:
```
	cd
	git clone git://github.com/akorshkov/kman.git ~/.kman
```
or
```
	git clone https://github.com/akorshkov/kman.git ~/.kman
```

2. Link `kman` to some PATH directory:
```
	ln -s ~/.kman/kman ~/bin/
```
